mathematics repository &amp; resources

## I know what you're thinking

Oh god - it's a mathematics repository. I have no idea how to start, where to start, why to start, and all of that good stuff. Listen, let me tell you something: I'm dumb. Be that as it may, it only encourages me to strengthen my knowledge and proceed to solve the mystery of my own ignorance. What is the reward? For now, nothing. Though it could in turn unlock possiblities never before imagined.

### Don't fret

It's a lot to overcome, and there will be many questions along the way. But please, feel free to join me for an adventure into impossible. The impossibly possible reality of mathematics and a trip that we will never return from. Thanks in advance, because we're sure in for a heck of a ride.
